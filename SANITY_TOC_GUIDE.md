## Overview
You can now easily control which headings appear in the "IN THIS ARTICLE" section of your blog posts using toggle switches!

## How to Use

### Step 1: Add/Edit Table of Contents Block

1. **Open your blog post** in Sanity Studio
2. **Click where you want the Table of Contents** (usually near the top of the article)
3. **Click the + button** to add a new block
4. **Select "Table of Contents"** from the list

### Step 2: Configure Which Headings to Show

1. **Click on the Table of Contents block** you just added
2. **Look for "Select Headings to Show/Hide"** field
3. You'll see a list of **ALL headings** (H1, H2, H3, H4) from your article with toggle switches

### Step 3: Toggle Headings On/Off

- **Toggle ON (Blue)** = Heading WILL appear in the TOC ✅
- **Toggle OFF (Gray)** = Heading will be HIDDEN from the TOC ❌

### Step 4: Save

- Click **Publish** to save your changes
- The Table of Contents will update automatically on your live site

## Features

✅ **Automatic Detection**: All headings are automatically found from your article  
✅ **Visual Toggles**: Easy on/off switches for each heading  
✅ **Live Preview**: See which headings are hidden (counter at the bottom)

## Example Use Cases

- Hide "Introduction" or "Conclusion" headings

## Troubleshooting

**No headings showing?**

- Save and refresh the page
- Check that the headings are inside the main article body

**Toggle not working?**
