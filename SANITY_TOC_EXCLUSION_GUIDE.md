# How to Exclude Headings from Table of Contents in Sanity Studio

## Overview
You can now control which headings (H1, H2, H3, H4) appear in the Table of Contents for your blog posts.

## Steps to Exclude a Heading

### Method 1: Using Block Settings Menu (⋮)

1. **Open your blog post** in Sanity Studio

2. **Click on the heading block** that you want to exclude from the TOC

3. **Click the three dots menu (⋮)** on the right side of the block

4. **Check the "Hide from Table of Contents" checkbox**

5. **Save your post**

### Method 2: Using Block Inspector

1. **Click on the heading block** 

2. **Look at the right sidebar** (Block Inspector panel)

3. **Check the "Hide from Table of Contents" checkbox**

4. **Save your post**

## What Happens

- Headings with "Hide from Table of Contents" checked will **NOT appear** in the "IN THIS ARTICLE" table of contents
- The heading will still appear normally in your blog post
- Only the table of contents listing is affected

## Example Use Cases

- Exclude intro/outro headings like "Conclusion" or "Final Thoughts"
- Hide repetitive section headings
- Control which headings are most important for navigation
- Keep the TOC clean and focused on main topics

## Important Notes

- The checkbox **only appears for heading blocks** (H1, H2, H3, H4)
- Normal paragraph blocks won't show this option
- You need to **restart Sanity Studio** after the schema changes to see the new option

## Removing the Exclusion

To make a heading appear in the TOC again:

1. Click on the heading block
2. Uncheck the "Hide from Table of Contents" checkbox
3. Save your post
